## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to position background images with *keywords*, as shown below. Also, the `background-attachment: fixed;` with *fixes* the background image and allows the **foreground** content to scroll over it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
img {
  background-image: url("some image path here");
  background-position: top right;
  background-attachment: fixed;
}
```
